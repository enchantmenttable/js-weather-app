You can:

- Lookup 5-day forecast in 3-hour steps. I get the data from OpenWeather. If you want to run the app on your computer, you'll need an API key to start using OpenWeather service (get your API key on https://openweathermap.org/).

- Search by entering an address. OpenStreetMap will return the closest location it could find. Entering only city names will probably give the most relevant results.
